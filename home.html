                    The chatbot is inspired by Key's solo song 'Good and Great' released in 2023.
                    The song is about employees trying to deal with the corporate world and ace in the competition.
                    So I thought why not build a chatBot to ease someone's hectic day at work and make them smile a bit?
                    And thus Tio was created!

                    Most of my projects are inspired by day-to-day observations or the media I am exposed to.
                    Like this one is based on Key's solo 'Good and Great'. You can spend your time checking out my other
                    projects and giving feedbacks.

                    Please show this WebApp more love and do look forward for future enhancements!
                    I'll try to enhance it more in the long run whenever I get time.
