                    The chatbot is inspired by Key's solo song 'Good and Great' released in 2023.
                    The song is about employees trying to deal with the corporate world and ace in the competition.
                    So I thought why not build a chatBot to ease someone's hectic day at work and make them smile a bit?
                    And thus Tio was created!
